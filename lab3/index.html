		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<p> The point of this lab was to create a home page linking to the other labs and create local file structures.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> My partner and I had some difficulty uploading an image from a local file. We ended up uploading our images to flickr and linking them in our code to our flickr site.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
			<p> My results show that I have created a homepage linking to the urls of each of my labs and future labs. I also created this page which shows how I uploaded screenshots and uploaded to the server.
