      <h2> Challenges </h2>
        <p> This lab wasn't very different from the last lab however the task x proved to be more difficult than I thought. </p>

      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p> The main problem I had was in Task X trying to get a function to change my endpoint URL to cycle through different comics. </p>

      <h2> Results </h2>
      <p> These are the results, I was able to display the comic using an API endpoint by clicking the button below. </p>
