<h1> Challenges </h1>
  <p> I had a lot of trouble understanding what the elements were used for in this lab </p>
<h2> Problems </h2>
  <p> I wasn't sure what to look for in this lab</p>
<h3> Results </h3>
<p> As a result I don't think I was able to fully complete this lab, since everytime I checked my console it said I had an unknown variable, yet I could not understand why. </p>
