			<p> Unfortunatley I had some problems loading up Slack this week and was unable to retrieve a partner. For the past two days I kept recieveing an error each time I tried logging into slack. I had to contact the UCSC support and got my email fixed but I was only able to get it back at 4pm on wednesday  </p>
