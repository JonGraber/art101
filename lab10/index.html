        <h2> Challenges </h2>
          <p> Adding the function from lab 7 to make sure it worked with the components from lab 10. </p>
        <h2> Problems </h2>
          <p> I was unable to figure out where and how to put the function sort from lab 7 into this lab. </p>
        <h2> Results </h2>
        <p> I ended up not putting the sort function however I did add the other functions from lab 10 into the output. </p>
