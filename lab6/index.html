			<h1> Challenges </h1>
			<p> I didn't really have many roadblocks in this lab, although the javascript code is difficult to understand. </p>
			<h2> Problems </h2>
			<p> I didn't have any problems getting the javascript onto my index, although my css is not exactly how I want the page to look. </p>
			<h3> Results </h3>
			<p> All in all I was able to complete this lab and put it online. </p>
