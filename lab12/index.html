      <h2> Challenges </h2>
        <p> This lab was challenging features because of the if and then statements that you had to create in code </p>

      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p> One problem I had was learning about different CSS features on my own </p>

      <h2> Results </h2>
      <p> I like the way the webpage came out and I completed what was needed </p>
