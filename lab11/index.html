    <h2> Challenges </h2>
      <p> The challenge for this lab was making sure the js library and the css lined up together </p>
      <button id="c-button">Click Me!</button>

  <div id="problems" class="sectionbox">
    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p> The only problem I had was the append function is the js was creating another button that wasn't found in my html </p>
    <button id="p-button">Click Here!</button>
  </div>
<div id="results" class="sectionbox">
    <h3> Results </h3>
    <p> By eliminating the append functions it also eliminated the extra button; all three buttons work as accordingly </p>
    <button id="r-button">Click This!</button>
