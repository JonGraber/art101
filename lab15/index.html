      <h2> Challenges </h2>
        <p> A challenge of this lab was constantly checking the end result to make sure the quote came out like I wanted it to.</p>

      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p> A problem I had was when I outputed the quote it had a ton of random things before and after but by adding .message to the end of JSON data it only would show the quote. </p>
